Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Libracoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant,
 near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Libracoin is an open 
 source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without 
 any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers
 individuals to control their own finances. Libracoin features faster 
 transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than 
 the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, 
 trade volume and liquidity, Libracoin is a proven medium of commerce 
 complementary to Bitcoin.

 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 5+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, libracoind, and the CLI tool
 libracoin-cli to interact with the daemon.
